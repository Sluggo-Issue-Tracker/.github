    small teams.
</p>

Features include *(note: most features in progress)*:
* Issue tracking via tickets, including the ability to assign tickets, track
  custom statuses on tickets, and track subtickets.
* Flexible tagging system on tickets to enable easy division of issues between
  teams. 
* Intelligent homepage feeds which enable team members to easily view tasks they
  should work on, or may be of interest to them.
* Team member tracking, including information such as bios.
* Modern interfaces across all applications
* REST API out-of-the-box for custom scripting and integration, with first-class
  citizen support to your custom scripts - they'll interact with the tracker the
  same way the official applications do!

  freely use, modify, and redistribute the tracker in your organization, or to
  contractors.
